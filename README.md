# Spik

Spik is a simple markup languaje and a set of tools to easily create and compose text for different speech
sentitizers. It compiles to SSML in different flavors.

## Languaje specification

The idea is to create a markup language like markdown or asciidoc (enriched to support most of the characteristics of SSML).

For the first version we will use the Asciidocs spec as is and translate what we can use to SSML.

## Asciidoc to SSML mapping

Optional: frontmatter that specifies the flavor

Headings (title and subtitles) ->  Emphasis tag
